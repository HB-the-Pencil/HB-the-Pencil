- Hello, I'm Henry Barcalow! I program on Khan Academy and GitHub under the username of HB_the_Pencil.
- Christian and proud of it! Also the oldest child in my family >:D
- Anyways, I'm a sort-of HTML and JS coder (mostly PJS) and I love helping bugtest JS games.
- Now I'm learning Python in a software development course at school!
- Can't wait to see what GitHub has to offer!
