- Hello, I'm HB_the_Pencil! (they wouldn't let me put underscores in my username so it's hyphens instead :P)
- Christian and proud of it! Also the oldest child in my family >:D
- Anyways, I'm a sort-of HTML and JS coder (mostly PJS) and I love helping bugtest JS games.
- I created a github account for easier bugtesting.
- Can't wait to see what GitHub has to offer!
