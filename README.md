Hello, I'm Henry Barcalow! I program on Khan Academy and GitHub under the username of HB_the_Pencil.

Some fun facts about me...
- Christian and proud of it! I try to live out my faith as much as possible.
- I'm the oldest child in my family :3
- I know some HTML/JS and got my start in ProcessingJS on Khan Academy.
- Now I'm learning Python in a software development course at school. I just got PCEP certified!

have a good day :D
